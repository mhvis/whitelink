# Whitelink

The aim of this project is to provide a private server instance which is only accessible for whitelisted IP addresses, and allow easy registration of the server users (players) using a web interface.

It can be used to provide private Impostor and Crewlink server instances with the following benefits for streamers:

* Low ping and high availability because there are no other players. Works even when the public Among Us or Crewlink servers are down.
* No risk of leaking lobby codes, heck you can even set the lobby to public, because only whitelisted people can access and see the lobby anyway. (Assuming you use the Impostor server.)
* No risk in leaking the Crewlink/Impostor server address, as only whitelisted people can use the server.

## How does it work?

Access to the server is restricted on the basis of IP address, using a firewall. This tool provides a web interface which lets players register their IP address in the whitelist, using a private code received from the host. This needs to be done only once for each player, after which they can access the private server indefinitely.

Web interface features:

* Directly see if you have access, i.e. if your IP is whitelisted.
* Host can grant access using a private code or secret URL.
* Host can view and revoke whitelisted people.


## I'm a streamer!

I will gladly setup a _beefy_ Crewlink+Impostor server for you in your cloud region of choice (e.g. US West) for free! I have capacity for a couple of cloud server instances which were provided to me for free in Microsoft Azure. DM me on Twitter or Discord or send a mail to _todo_! You will receive the server address of your private server within a couple of hours.
